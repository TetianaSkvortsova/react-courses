    <span>Hey everyone! The annual Global Tech Conference is right around the corner, and I'm so excited to be
attending this year. It's a fantastic opportunity to connect with some of the most innovative minds in the industry and
learn about the latest trends shaping our future.
The event kicks off on 10.25.2025 and runs through November 2,
2025. Be sure to check out the full schedule and speaker lineup at https://globaltechconference.com.
I'm particularly looking forward to the keynote speech on AI ethics, scheduled for October 28, 2025, at 10 a.m. PST.
